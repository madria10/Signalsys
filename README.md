    <h1>Signals and System - SEM 3 | 2024 - Delhi University</h1>
    <p>
        This repository contains practical programs and scripts developed for the 
        <strong>Signals and System</strong> course using Scilab. The focus is on applying mathematical concepts 
        to solve equations, model systems, and analyze results effectively.
    </p>
    <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
    <p>By completing this set of practicals, learners will be able to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Perform operations with various forms of complex numbers to solve equations.</li>
        <li>Use mathematics as a tool for solving and modelling systems in electronics.</li>
        <li>Prepare comprehensive technical reports on experiments and results.</li>
    </ul>
